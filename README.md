# HydroPowerRL: Reinforcement Learning for Hydro Reservoir Management

## Project Overview

HydroPowerRL is a reinforcement learning project designed to optimize water release decisions in a hydroelectric reservoir. The goal is to maximize electricity generation revenue while maintaining reservoir safety by avoiding floods and droughts.

This project uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent trained on synthetic hourly inflow and electricity price data to learn effective reservoir management strategies.

- Custom OpenAI Gym environment modeling hydro reservoir dynamics and constraints.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation for learning optimal release policies.
- Visualization of training progress and agent performance.
- Clear and modular Python code suitable for adaptation to real-world datasets.
